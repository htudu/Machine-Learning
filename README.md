# Machine-Learning
The LSTM network is the starting point. What you are really interested in is how to use the LSTM to address sequence prediction problems. The way that the LSTM network is used as layers in sophisticated network architectures. The way that you will get good at applying LSTMs is by knowing about the different useful LSTM networks and how to use them.
